FirefoxCustomSelect
===================
Unlike Chrome and IE, Firefox does not remove the default drop down arrows with the -webkit-appearance:none; css attribute.
Instead you end up with your custom selector behind the default arrow.

This demo shows a css fix to remove the ugly default arrow and keep your pretty custom one :)

View the firefoxdemo.html file in the FFCustomSelect folder in Firefox Browser for a demonstration and explanation of the code.
